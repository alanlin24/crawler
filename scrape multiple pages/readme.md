there are two major types of http methods when disigning a website with multiple pages - get and post. <br>
To put it simply, we can tell the two apart by checking whether the url change along with we browse through different pages. <br>
Get - explicitly display the page number as part of url. <br>
Post - no relative info in the url. <br>
